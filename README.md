# Spotify Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a project that utilizes the Spotify API to collect data and perform analysis on Spotify users and their listening habits. 

## Data Pipeline
The data pipeline is built using Python and utilizes the Spotify Web API to retrieve data about users, playlists, and tracks. The data is then stored in a SQL database for easy querying and analysis. The pipeline is designed to be easily scalable and can be run on a schedule to continually update the database with new data.

## Data Analysis
The project includes a number of data analysis scripts that can be run on the collected data to answer questions about Spotify users and their listening habits. These scripts cover a wide range of topics, including:
- User demographic analysis
- User playlist analysis
- User listening history analysis
- Track popularity and repeat listening analysis
- Personalized music recommendation analysis

## Usage
To use this repository, you'll need to have Python and a SQL database installed on your machine. You'll also need to obtain a Spotify API key and configure the data pipeline with your API key and database credentials. Once you have everything set up, you can run the data pipeline to collect data from the Spotify API and store it in your database. Then, you can run the various data analysis scripts to perform analysis on the collected data.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive solution for collecting and analyzing data from the Spotify API. With the data pipeline and data analysis scripts included in this repository, you'll be able to get a wealth of insights into Spotify users and their listening habits, and make data-driven decisions about how to engage with your users and improve their experience on the platform.
